In this R-notebook, you will learn :
- How to do a **single dimension analysis** to expose some features of an image ;
- To understand **correlations** between colors and what message they may convey ;
- What the **K-means algorithm** is and how it can be used to extract information in this use case ;
- How to perform a simple **hierarchical clustering** and what it highlights in an image ;
- What a **principal component analysis** is a how it can be used in this situation.

To this notebook, you will need :
- to have `R` 3.2.3 or greater installed already ;
- to have `jupyter-notebook` installed. If not, you may run : `pip install jupyter==1.0.0` ;
- to have an `R` kernel installed for `jupyter-notebook`. To do so you may follow [these instructions](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/) ;
- to start the notebook once everything is installed by running `jupyter-notebook
